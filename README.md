Product Goal:
By the end of this term, our users will be able to track which games theyâ€™ve beaten, organize them into lists and tier lists, leave reviews, and gain points for interacting with these features and doing daily check-ins to increase their level and unlock customization options, to allow people who play video games to have a fun and interactive space to rate and categorize games.

Definition of Done: 
Done means coded to standards, reviewed and implemented, including the sprint planning, scrum meeting, and retrospective review. The database, the base html, and user data survey goals have also been fulfilled.
